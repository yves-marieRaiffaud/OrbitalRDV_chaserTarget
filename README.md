# Rendez-vous simulation between a chaser and a target, using Matlab Simulink

Simulation, using LVLH frame, of the phasing & rendez-vous of a chaser and a target on circular and near-circular orbit (Clohessyâ€“Hill-Wiltshire equations)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yves-marieRaiffaud/OrbitalRDV_chaserTarget
```

## Running
In matlab, open and run the `SimulinkLauncher.m`. It will open the `orbitGuidance_LVLH.slx` simulink file and start the simulation. Once simulation is complete, Matlab will plot and show the graphs coded in the `SimulinkLauncher.m` file.

The followings figure have been made to confirm that the LVLH plot and the simulation propagator are working as expected
Assumptions for the results hereunder:
* Start positions for both the chaser and the target are the same (explaining why the chaser trajectory in figure 2 starts at the origin/the target position) 
* Target is on a circular orbit with an apogee radius of 6578 km (200 km altitude) ==> orbital velocity of 7784 m/s.
* Chaser is initially on a near circular orbit (7783 m/s). At timestep 0, a boost of 100 m/s is applied on the chaser. When the chaser is at timestep orbitalPeriod/2, a second boost of 100 m/s is applied. As a result and after these 2 boosts, the chaser is slowly drifting at 1 m/s with respect to the target.
